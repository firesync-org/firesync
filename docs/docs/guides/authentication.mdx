# Authentication

FireSync uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) for authentication. To grant a user access to FireSync documents you should create a JWT that specifies which documents the user can access. The JWT is signed by a secret that only you and FireSync know, so FireSync can confirm the user is authorized by you.

The JWT should be crated and signed on your backend, where the shared secret is available. Never make the JWT secret available in your client code. Once the token is signed & generated pass it to your client user's client where it can be included with requests to FireSync.

## Configure your secret

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="environment">
<TabItem value="firesync-cloud" label="FireSync Cloud" default>
```

Your secrets can be found in your project settings in firesync cloud.

![project-settings](/screenshots/project-settings.png)

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="firesync-server" label="FireSync Server">
```

Configure your JWT secret with the [`FS_JWT_AUTH_SECRET`](/reference/firesync-server/configuration#fs_jwt_auth_secret) environment variable:

```bash
$ export FS_JWT_AUTH_SECRET='/B?E(H+KbPeShVmYq3t6w9zDC&F)J@Nc'
```

To generate a random secret from the command line you can use openssl:

```bash
$ openssl rand -base64 32
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Generate a JWT

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js" default>
```

Install the `jsonwebtoken` library:

```bash
$ npm install --save jsonwebtoken
```

In your backend code sign the token to pass to your frontend client code:

```js
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

const payload = {
  docs: {
    // Grant write access to the document called 'foo' and readonly access to 'bar'
    foo: "write",
    bar: "read",
  },
};
const secret = "/B?E(H+KbPeShVmYq3t6w9zDC&F)J@Nc";

// Pass token to your client
const token = jwt.sign(payload, secret);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">
```

Install the `jwt` library:

```bash
$ pip install jwt
```

In your backend code sign the token to pass to your frontend client code:

```python
import jwt

payload = {
  'docs': {
    # Grant write access to the document called 'foo' and readonly access to 'bar'
    'foo': 'write',
    'bar': 'read'
  }
}
secret = '/B?E(H+KbPeShVmYq3t6w9zDC&F)J@Nc'

# Pass token to your client
token = jwt.encode(payload, secret)

print(token)
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Configure FireSync Client

Pass the token you have generated on your backend to the frontend client to allow the user access to the specified documents:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="environment">
<TabItem value="firesync-cloud" label="FireSync Cloud" default>
```

```js
import FireSync from "@firesync/client";

const firesync = new FireSync({
  projectName: "acme-dev",
  token: token, // Generated above
});
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="firesync-server" label="FireSync Server">
```

```js
import FireSync from "@firesync/client";

const firesync = new FireSync({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:5000",
  token: token, // Generated above
});
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
