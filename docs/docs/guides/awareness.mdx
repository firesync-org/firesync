# Awareness

FireSync supports the [Yjs Awareness Protocol](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/about-awareness) which can be used for syncing temporary state between connected clients such as who is online, cursor positions, and other state that doesn't need to be saved.

## Example

Let's look at a quick example showing how to use awareness to track online users.


:::tip Subscribe to doc

To use awareness, you must first subscribe to the doc with the same `docKey` with `firesync.subscribe(docKey)`.

:::


```js
const docKey = 'my-document'
firesync.subscribe(docKey)
const awareness = firesync.awareness(docKey)

// Listen for changes to who is connected
awareness.on('change', () => {
  // Returns a Map of client id to user state
  const clientStates = awareness.getStates()
  
  console.log('Online users are:')
  for (const clientState of clientStates.values()) {
    console.log(clientState.user.name)
  }
})

// Set our own name for other users to see
awareness.setLocalStateField('user', {
  name: 'Bob'
})
```

## How it works

Each connected client has its own entry in `awareness.getStates()`. The key corresponds to the client id and the value is a javascript object that clients can store arbitrary data on depending on what information you want to sync between clients.

:::tip Client Ids

Note that the client id is not the same as the user id in your system. The client id is unique to each browser tab, so if a user has multiple tabs open they may have multiple entries in `awareness.getStates()` with different client ids.

:::

When a client disconnects, their entry is automatically removed from the awareness state. Clients send a regular heartbeat message and the client will also be removed from the awareness state if a heartbeat message doesn't arrive for over 30 seconds.

## More Examples

### Rich text cursors

The bindings for rich-text editors like [Quill](/guides/rich-text/quill) can use an awareness instance to sync data about where users cursors are:

```js
const doc = firesync.subscribe(docKey)
const awareness = firesync.awareness(docKey)
const quill = document.getElementById('quill')
const binding = new QuillBinding(doc.getText('t'), quill, awareness)
```

:::info Live Example

This rich text editor below is a Quill instance connected to FireSync. Open this page in another browser to see the collaboration in action, or share this URL with someone else.

:::

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => {
    const { QuillEditor } = require('@site/src/components/QuillEditor');
    return <QuillEditor docKey="awareness-cursors" initialValue="This editor supports real-time collaboration with shared cursors. Open in another tab to try it out!" />
  }}
</BrowserOnly>
